        W3C benefits from diverse, inclusive, and worldwide participation. This document provides guidance
        to those organizing distributed meetings.

      <h2 id='timezones'>Dealing with timezones</h2>

      <blockquote cite='https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#distributed-meeting'>
            <p>A distributed meeting is one where most of the attendees are expected to participate from remote locations
               (e.g., by telephone, video conferencing, or IRC).</p>
            <p>&mdash; <a href='https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#distributed-meeting'>W3C Process Document</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A chair should build consensus about the time slots for distributed meetings and should
	 reevaluate that consensus on a regular basis. A good practice is to re-evaluate round both the semi-annual spring and fall shifts in summer time, and upon significant changes in membership or participation.
      </p>

      <p>When scheduling regularly occurring distributed meetings, the Chair should consider rotating meeting times
      if that will help a broader group of members to participate.</p>

      <p>A chair might use the following steps for proposing time slots:
      <ul>
        <li>Collect participants' time zones</li>
        <li>Propose candidate time slots, at least some of which start beween 6:00am and 12:00am in each participant's timezone
                (see <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?iso=20210127&p1=240&p2=248&p3=33&p4=195&p5=136&p6=43&p7=64&p8=224">World Clock Meeting Planner</a>)
        </li>
        <li>If using a tool such as doodle.com to collect feedback, provide alternative mechanisms to participants who
	have trouble accessing the tool</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A chair should consider the following when judging the group's consensus:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritize preferences of core participants based on the meeting agenda</li>
        <li>Prioritize the major preference of the other members but should take account that a
                  preference of the majority in a time zone area has an equivalent priority to
                  those of the majority in other time zone areas.</li>
         <li>If the group can not reach a consensus, the Chair has the discretion to make
               a decision.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#GeneralMeetings">W3C Process</a>
	  provides rules about the timing of meeting announcements and agenda publication.
      </p>
      </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id='calendars'>Group calendars</h2>

      <p>The additional tooling requirements are still being worked and will not be
            part of the initial release of the W3C Calendar system. The W3C Calendar system will support timezones but
      not provide facilitation for finding suitable times within a set of timezones. In the meantime, we recommend using
      online resources, such as <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?p1=43&p2=195&p3=224&p4=33&p5=248&p6=136&p7=64&p8=216&p9=152">timeanddate</a>
      and <a href="https://doodle.com/">doodle</a>.
