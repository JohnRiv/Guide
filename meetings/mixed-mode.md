# Mixed-Mode (Hybrid) Group Meetings

ASSUMPTION: Sometime in ~~2021~~2022 we will need to field requests from groups to have in-person meetings.  This will start with a subset of the group being willing to meet f2f while others are unable or unwilling to travel.  We may also have multiple subgroups gathered in different places in addition to scattered individuals.

> [JB suggests that Hybrid is already happening, and it open and close unpredictable, and we indicate our cognizance of that]

> [JB: when we distribute this, include introductory text to frame it in a positive, optimistic way]

**Status**: this document is for discussion purposes.  PLH, Judy, and Ralph have were working outside of GitHub until Nov'21.

~~2021-07-30: Ralph will turn this pad into a GH pull request 2021-11-09 done~~
 
 TODO: Do a training session on chairing a virtual meeting
 TODO: Establish a repository to collect lessons learned during 2020 (TPAC breakouts, etc.)
 TODO: Figure out the structure to integrate in /Guide (given overlap with continuity page, workshops, etc.)
 TODO: Consider whether W3C should create hardware kits to loan to a meeting host
 TODO: Look at https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-rooms-reentering-the-office-hybrid-workforce/ for ideas

Mixed mode meetings are different from all-virtual meetings, and it is challenging to fully include remote participants when some people are in a room(s) together.
 
Challenges of Hybrid meetings:
* Comments from David Singer, to be integrated:
  They are really hard, as you know.

  Somehow, you have to respect the contradictions:
  * people who have traveled expect to use the time fully, with all the opportunities for debate and so on.
  * people who are virtual can’t be expected to be online for 8 hours straight, especially when they are in another timezone
  * everyone needs to feel that they are equal participants (or it’s actually a f2f meeting with best-effort call-in)

MPEG is struggling with designing this. There, we’re thinking of confining meetings that make or confirm decisions to the usual virtual short slots, and have the opportunity for extended discussion and yes, proposed decisions, on a best-effort basis. So you split the sessions into two classes.
    
* getting relevant & clear info about participants' needs in advance, including accommodation, travel logistics, dietary, allergies
  * plan for fallbacks for every critical item, including a backup venue
  * supplies of PPE must be available
* duration
* timezone
* seeing and being seen
  * whiteboarding / flipcharting
  * camera placement in meeting room
  * screen(s) large enough and placed well enough to show remote participants equivalently
* hearing and being heard
  * queuing (floor control) 
  * microphone quality in room
  * echo and background noise from remote participants
* socializing
  * breaks
  * group dinners
* technical
  * equipment not working as promised and not having been tested in advance
  * bandwidth / latency insufficiencies for all the groups meeting simultaneously
* Will there be multiple hubs that need to be interconnected?
 
## Prepare your agenda

> [JB -- an intro high-level statement would help, for instance.]

Plan and prepare your agenda to be flexible to potentially changing logistics, for instance, presenters or participants to plan to attend in person but get a positive Covid test on pre-check and need to switch to remote participation, or planned venues that become unavailable at the last minute.
 
Don't expect to cover everything within one or two days: not all items
may make it to a face-to-face meeting. Favor items that require a non-remote
meeting (eg whiteboard), based on in-room participation.
 Otherwise organize dedicating remote meetings for the other agenda items.
 
Organize the timing around your agenda items and smaller groups
* Not all agenda items require everyone to be there
* Smaller groups/breakouts means better timezone management
* Require reports from the smaller groups

## Convening the meeting
 
 State the policies of engagement; Process, CEPC, PPE, venue precautions, emergency contacts
 
> [JB -- I suggest moving this to up, and including comments related to Covid logistics, for instance...] 

* remind the participant of the rules of engagement at the start of each meeting
* review for all participants any Covid-safety requirements and agreements
* remind people of CEPC requirements including always bearing in mind that some different participants have different levels of high risk(?), and to respect people's requests for care on social distancing
* Clearly document the venue requirements for COVID tests.  Consider what additional requirements W3C can and should add.

> [JB: recommend W3C establish some baseline requirements that are cognizant of the global situation.]

* Patent policy?
  if you are recording the meeting, you MUST get explicit consent from participants

## Managing breaks/social activity

   Allow for breaks by providing a variety of social environments for remote participants, relevant to the size of the group, and interest. Consider doing a social gatherings that are inclusive of remote participants

> [JB -- let's consider having a central list of ideas of events that are easy to put together, easy to make inclusive/accessible, and easy to do in hybrid mode]
   
   What suggestions can we offer for self-organized social rooms  (e.g. repurposing breakout tools (gather.town, wonder.me, ...)?

> [JB] Ensure that multiple people involved in convening the event are well-informed and experienced on using relevant features of video-conferencing platform, such as self-organizing break-out rooms, and that there is technical back-up readily available]

 
## Managing the queue
 
Chairs, please make sure to manage the queue,

> [JB] including in-room as well as remote queuing, and don't use your Chair hat to insert your own opinions (queue like everyone else to do so)

> [JB note technical bug in some platforms such as Zoom where host cannot queue themselves to express an opinion with their chair hat off -- we should get zoom to fix this]

> [RRS also note that some platforms don't indicate the order in which participants raised their hands]

> [RRS: a big opportunity exists here to integrate queue-management across platforms]

Prevent queue interruptions. The conversation moves forward based on
    the queue, not on the loudest participant in the room.

> [JB -- let's discuss -- this strikes me as rigid guidance, and in some cases Chair needs to be managing queue according to a flow of relevant topics. Another technical problem here is that some video-conference queueing doesn't allow indication of topic.]

Ask participants to mute unless they have the floor.

> [JB] For large groups, it can be helpful to use mute-by-default, with Chair, or queue-manager-assistant, unmuting those who come up in queue -- but this can slow things down. If not mute-by-default, essential that Chair or someone has abilility to mute remote participants.]
 
Split the queue into sub-topic if needed, to facilitate follow-ups on individual comments.
 
@@how to manage zakim+zoom queue
   
> [JB thinks that there are so many variables regarding what works in different settings with different people for queue management, that the most important bottom line is to be flexible -- but with suggestions.]
> [Acknowledge that something that was suggested/recommended practice last month may have been overtaken by subsequent changes.]

## Equipment: 

Plan from scratch what equipment we need to really do hybrid well, e.g., large screen(s) and good tech crew at the hub(s); and reliable set-ups for the remote folks...

> [JB and RS brainstorming, 20211015]
    
## Get your audio/video right

Consider unfortunate contingencies like the tech doesn't work as expected or the physical meeting room(s) getting disconnected from the net or having a fire alarm -- and all of these things and more have indeed happened, so think carefully about contingency planning. Will (should?) those in the room continue to meet while they're disconnected from the net?  Will the (other) remote participants continue to meet while those in the meeting room are milling about in a parking lot waiting for the fire department? Will remote participants already have fall-back channel info?  How will the partiioned meeting know that it has been partitioned?

> [JB:  ;) -- discuss emergency logistics more generally, and the fact that most of them will eventually happen.]

Essential to have a fall-back video conference option that can be activitied.

* Put your remote participants on a large display in the meeting room
* Give your remote participants a "gist" camera view of the whole room. [High value addition that Pluto arranged in Seattle IDIW Workshop]
* Make sure everyone can be heard clearly in the room and remotely
* We need to recommend specific AV tech/requirements (specific enough for orders to be placed with an A/V contractor). Can W3C offer a travelling kit that team contacts can bring to their meetings? What kind of constraints can we put on the host?
* Pay particular attention to positioning of cameras, screen, and microphones -- especially when communication accommodations including captioning and/or interpreting are in use. Note that the position of the microphone(s) is very likely to need to be separate from the camera view(s).
* If your agenda includes parallel breakout sessions, make plans in advance for supporting those for remote participants.
 
* Make sure everyone can be seen. Room participants should consider using their own laptop
   video for remote participants to have a direct view of them. (note this will dramatically increase bandwidth consumption)
* Remember that not all presenters or participants, regardless of whether in room or remote, can see who is in the room or what is being projected.
* Take your minutes online, for everyone to see in realtime
* If slides are presented, everyone MUST be able to read them -- particularly discourage screen sharing unless the document(s) are also available on the web; screen sharing should only be used as a way to keep everyone in sync as to what material you are discussing. Make sure the slides meet WCAG 2.1 AA and "How to Make your Presentations Accessible."
* If a whiteboard is used, the view must not be blocked from any participant in the room, and must be available to all remote participants.
* Consider training for your participants on to use the realtime collaboration tools (such as unmuting quickly)
* When the platform supports it, pin key windows in place -- speaker, content, interpreter, captions -- etc.... 
  
 
* Open your remote video room 30 minutes prior to the start of the meeting, to make
    sure everyone is ready
* Request to test the video/audio room setting in advance to avoid bad surprises
* Offer to test the participants settings in advance
* do NOT make video recordings or screen captures without the explicit consent of the participants. 

@@how do one get the explicit consent if the individual joined late and missed the disclaimer before the start of the recording? A: ensure that the video tool is clearing indicating that it is recording, and add a reminder with agendas. A' provide an agenda template that includes a boilerplate notice.
      
## Tooling & Support

[provide some tooling recommendation. See also https://github.com/w3c/w3process/issues/435 for ongoing Process CG discussion, https://github.com/w3c/Guide/issues/78 in the Continuity conversation, and https://github.com/w3c/AB-memberonly/issues/30 in the AB rules/best-practices for tools discussion.
 
 ?Are there any unique requirements or desiderata for the new group calendar system to support hybrid meetings?
 
## Room Setup Expectations
 
?Should we attempt to provide equipment to be able to use a meeting room that has insufficient built-in conferencing equipment
 
?If we provide equipment, how much setup time should we expect to require
